TO DO (16/05/2014)

- "get connect" method for the signal node
- add drotate[xyz]
- allow the regexp in the node msg (sync, connect)
- implement a new "link" object (like in Rouages)
- handling the errors with signals ?
- other signal connections :  clock ? show ? rows/columns ? ...
- think of another figure to explain the adresses in OSCMsg.tex (with other levels, and sync/sig nodes)

some problems to solve :

- the staves and the notes don't rotate the same way (probably a Qt problem ?)
- video problem
